# Team-Profile-Generator
## Description
This homework assignment required me to create a Team Profile Generator. My motivation was to familiarize myself with further with using the terminal along with node.js. The purpose of this assignment was to generate employee profiles, in the terminal, after the user answered prompted questions; the end result, is a generated and completed html. I built this assignment to learn how much code is required, as well as, how to structure and develop such code in order to get the generator to work properly. The problem solved concerns finding out what are the first steps in creating logical lines of code while at the same time, making sure that the code functions as I intended. I learned primarily how confusing node.js can be, especially since we are unable to spend much time on it. However, with more repetition, I am positive that my ability to use node.js will improve significantly. This assignment also reminded how important capitalization is; one missed capitalization, prevented the ability to add more employees after the first employee was added.

## Installation
I have to place my work onto Github. First you have to create a new repository and give it a name. Be sure to make this new repository public and add a readme. Once that is done, there will be a green button, and once clicked, clone will be at the top with three options underneath. Click the ssh option. And then copy the link. Then go to the terminal. open the directory (type in ls) and then change into the specific directory (type in cd and the name of the directory) that you would like to place this project. Then you have to run a git add . command, followed by, a git commit -m "enter description of changes made" command. Then lastly run a git push command to publish the project onto Github.
